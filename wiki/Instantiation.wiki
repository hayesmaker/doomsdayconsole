#summary Creating new objects

The `new` command allows you to instantiate objects at run-time, returning a reference to the created instance. This can be used by advanced users as a subcommand.

===Examples===

{{{
call addChild (new flash.display.Sprite)
}}}

{{{
select myArray
call push (new package.MyClass)
}}}

Arguments to the class constructor can be passed as further arguments of the command as such

{{{
select myTextField
call setTextFormat (new flash.text.TextFormat _sans 30) 0 10
}}}
