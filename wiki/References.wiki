#summary Using object references in commands

= Introduction =

While arguments are typically parsed from the command string to numbers and so forth, often you want to pass an object into a function as an argument. The console offers commands which let you associate a string value with a reference to a scope by wrapping it in <angle brackets>.

=== Usage ===
{{{getReference _name_}}} gets a reference to the current scope. 
{{{ 
select mySprite
getReference myReferenceName
back
select myOtherSprite
call addChild <myReferenceName>
}}}
In addition, {{{getReferenceByName}}} gets a reference to a named object.
{{{
getReferenceByName mySprite myReferenceName
call addChild <myReferenceName>
}}}

=== Further commands ===
*listReferences* Print available references and their names

*clearReferences* Clear all references

*selectByReference _name_* Sets the current scope to the specified reference

*clearReference _name_* Removes the specified reference
