#summary Using object references in commands

= Introduction =

While arguments are typically parsed from the command string to numbers and so forth, often you want to pass an object into a function as an argument. The console offers the {{{getReference _name_}}} command, which lets you associate a string value with a reference to a scope by wrapping it in <angle brackets>

=== Usage ===
{{{ 
select mySprite
getReference myReferenceName
back
select myOtherSprite
call addChild <myReferenceName>
}}}

=== Further commands ===
*listReferences* Print available references and their names

*clearReferences* Clear all references

=== Upcoming ===

A syntax override letting you get a reference by its scope name, rather than having to enter that scope and getting it from there, for instance {{{getReference scopeName myReferenceName}}}
