#summary Locking the Console.

The `Console` can be locked such that only a *keyboard sequence* or *secret password* is the only way to unlock and toggle on the `Console`.
This is useful when embedding the `Console` as a _extra utility__ in a *production mode application* that is not readily available to the end user.


====Using a secret====

{{{
  ...
  addChild(ConsoleUtil.instance);

  // Now lock the Console with the secret.
  var secret:String = "Mega1234!!";
  ConsoleUtil.lock(secret);
}}}


====Using a keyCode sequence====

{{{
  ...
  addChild(ConsoleUtil.instance);

 // Now lock the console with the Konami Code
  var keyCodes:Array = [ KeyBindings.UP, KeyBindings.UP, 
                         KeyBindings.DOWN, KeyBindings.DOWN, 
                         KeyBindings.LEFT, KeyBindings.RIGHT, 
                         KeyBindings.LEFT, KeyBindings.RIGHT, 
                         KeyBindings.a, KeyBindings.b ];
  ConsoleUtil.lockWithKeyCodes(keyCodes);
}}}


====Note====

_The functionality described above is not intended to be used when the console is already toggled on, it is meant as to be used when `Console` is being added,
and should not be visible or available directly to the end user. _
