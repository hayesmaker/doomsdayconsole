#summary Customizing your invocation keystroke

The default keystroke for toggling the console is shift+tab, but you are free to change this to any combination of held down keys.

To do this, use the setInvokeKeys method of the DConsole class in the following way

{{{
ConsoleUtil.instance.setInvokeKeys(KeyBoard.SPACE,KeyBoard.CTRL,KeyBoard.SHIFT,KeyBoard.ENTER);
}}}

At least one key code is required.
