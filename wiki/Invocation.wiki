#summary Customizing your invocation keystroke

The default keystroke for toggling the console is shift+enter, but you are free to change this to any combination of held down keys.

To do this, use the setKeyStroke method of the ConsoleUtil class.

{{{
public static function setKeyStroke(keyCodes:Array = null, charCodes:Array = null):void
}}}

Example use:

{{{
//The default keystroke
ConsoleUtil.setKeyStroke([KeyBoard.SHIFT,KeyBoard.ENTER]);
//Quake style
ConsoleUtil.setKeyStroke(null,["|".charCodeAt()]);
}}}

At least one key or char code is required.
