#summary Customizing your invocation keystroke

The default keystroke for toggling the console is shift+enter, but you are free to change this to any combination of held down keys.

To do this, use the setKeyboardShortcut method of the ConsoleUtil class.

{{{
public static function setKeyStroke(keystroke:uint, modifier:unt):void
}}}

Example use:

{{{
//The default keystroke
ConsoleUtil.setKeyboardShortcut([KeyBindings.ENTER,KeyBindings.ALT_SHIFT]);
//Quake style
ConsoleUtil.setKeyStroke(KeyBindings.toKeyCode("|"),KeyBindings.NONE]);
}}}
